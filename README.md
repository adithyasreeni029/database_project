Welcome to database_works, a personal repository where I’ve organized my MySQL classwork and homework exercises. 
These scripts reflect my learning journey through relational database concepts, query writing, and schema design as part of my coursework at GEC Thrissur.
What's Included :
- SQL Practice Files:
- Table creation with constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK)
- Data manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Query exercises using SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING, and subqueries
- Normalization examples (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- Basic views and indexing
This repository helps me:
- Practice and reinforce SQL concepts taught in class
- Build confidence in writing clean, correct queries
- Track my progress and share my learning with others
